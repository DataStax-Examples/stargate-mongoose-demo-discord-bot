Steps to run Bot:
1. Create a config.json with the keys from example.json and the values from the developer portal and your discord server
2. run node ./deploy-commands.js
3. run node ./index.js

You should now be able to run the discord bot in your server locally.

Anytime you add or update commmands in the command folder, run step 2 again.

All replies must be strings.
